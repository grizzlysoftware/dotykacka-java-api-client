a note to myself from future:

hello me from the future, in order to publish artifact in sonatype, you have to invoke following providing specific properties:

RELEASE_TYPE=SNAPSHOT \
SIGNING_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
SIGNING_KEY_PATH=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
SONATYPE_USERNAME=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
SONATYPE_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
gradlew clean publishArtifact i

checkout the artifacts in here:
https://oss.sonatype.org/

firstly SNAPSHOT, then RELEASE.

"yours" sincerely,
you from the past

PS. you have a mess in your gpg keys, so if something is f*cked up - you deserved it
PS2. hello again, if gradle is complaining about not configured signatory it means that it does
not see environment variables form above. Make sure that you are invoking gradle, it's tasks and env variables
from single command.
